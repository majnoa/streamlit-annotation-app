### üìã Annotator Guidelines

Welcome! Thank you so much for taking part in this user study. 
            
Your task: review the similarity of the two given labels/phrases


- You will be shown **pairs of labels** and asked to rate how similar they are.
- We also provide definitions for each label to help you understand their meanings if needed 
    (sometimes the word given in the definition do not perfectly match please ignore that and treat it as a definition of the label). 
- Use the **radio buttons** to choose a similarity level from 0 to 4.

Notes:
- All questions on a page must be answered before submission to be properly stored.
- to indicate that your answer was accepted the backround color of the questions will change from gray to black
- Once all questions on a page are answered, a **submit button appears** at the bottom to submit your answers for the whole page
- Submit one page at a time. 
- After submitting a page, you cannot change your answers for that page and your answers are saved for next time you log in.
            
**BUG**: for the last question on the page to change color after annotation you sometimes need to click another option of that question.
Sorry for the inconvenience. 
            
!!!! You may return later to complete the rest !!!! 
just use the same ID to continue where you left off.

If you have any questions, contact me either 
via email mnoack@go.olemiss.edu or phone +1 662 380 1662 (whatapp, direct message, or call).
